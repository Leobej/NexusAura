Project: Nexus Aura

Concept: A simplified social media app focusing on text and image posts, with basic user profiles and following/followers. This project serves as a comprehensive learning exercise, incorporating modern development practices and technologies.

Features:

Post creation (text and images)
User profiles
Following/followers
Basic feed display
Technologies:

Backend: Java with Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA (for database interaction), PostgreSQL/MySQL database. RESTful API design.
Android App: Kotlin, Retrofit (for network requests), Glide/Picasso (for image loading), Room (for local caching - optional).
Flutter App (iOS and Android): Flutter, http package (for network requests), cached_network_image package (for image loading).
Web App: React.js, axios/fetch (for API calls), state management (Redux/Context API).
Containerization: Docker for containerizing the backend and frontend applications, as well as the database.
Orchestration: Kubernetes for deploying and managing the containerized applications.
CI/CD: Jenkins for automating the build, test, and deployment process, including Docker image building, pushing to a Docker registry, and Kubernetes deployments.
Version Control: Git
Development Focus:

Backend: User authentication (JWT), post management, follow/unfollow functionality, feed generation.
Android App: User authentication, post creation (camera integration), feed display, user profiles, push notifications (FCM).
Flutter App: Cross-platform development (iOS and Android), user authentication, post creation, feed display, user profiles.
Web App: User authentication, post creation, feed display, user profile management, advanced post filtering and sorting.
CI/CD: Automating the entire software delivery pipeline, from code commit to deployment in Kubernetes.
Deployment Environment:

The application will be deployed and managed within a Kubernetes cluster, leveraging Docker containers for consistent environments and scalability.

CI/CD Pipeline:

A Jenkins pipeline will automate the following steps:

Code commit to Git repository.
Backend and frontend build process.
Docker image creation and push to a Docker registry.
Deployment to the Kubernetes cluster.
This updated description clearly outlines the technologies used, including the CI/CD and containerization aspects, giving a comprehensive overview of the project's scope.Okay, here's the updated project description for the simplified social media app, incorporating the CI/CD and containerization aspects:
